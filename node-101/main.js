//use the shebang to tell javascript to use node to run this file without having to type 'node' in the terminal. You will have to type './' before the filename and use the '.js' file entension, plus you will have to make the file executable with "chmod +x executablefilename.js"

// "global" and "process" are true global objects. Other properties we have access to are passed into each module by Node nd are therefore available in every module, but are local to that module

// This is what the "invisible" function looks like that Node wraps around every js file. We never see this or modify it. This is just so you can get a visual fix on what's going on in a Node module
// (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { 
   // The code we write will be here});
// }

console.log('This is a module in my Node.js application');

// See the top level global object
console.log('the whole enchilada', process );

// See the process object and inspect it for things we will use often, 
// like argv, stdout, stdin
console.log('the current running Node envoronment', process );

// quit the app whenever we want. Nothing will run after this
// process.exit();
